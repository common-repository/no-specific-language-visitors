If you have created your own language pack, or have an update of an existing one, you can send [gettext PO and MO files](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress) to [Arefly](http://www.arefly.com/about/) so that I can bundle it into No Specific Language Visitors. You can download the latest [POT file](http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/no-specific-language-visitors/trunk/lang/no-specific-language-visitors.pot).
